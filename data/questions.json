        "question": "Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy",
        "answer": "Shallow Copy:\n• Points to the same memory address as the original variable.\n• Modifying the shallow copy can affect the original object.\n• Usage: copy.copy(original_object)\n\nDeep Copy:\n• Creates a completely independent copy of the object, with different memory addresses.\n• Modifying the deep copy will not affect the original object.\n• Usage: copy.deepcopy(original_object)"

        "question": "Implicit Wait vs Explicit Wait",
        "answer": "Implicit Wait:\n• WebDriver waits for a specified time for an element before throwing an exception.\n• Applies to all elements globally in the script.\n• Example: driver.implicitly_wait(10)\n\nExplicit Wait:\n• WebDriver waits for a specific condition (e.g., element being clickable).\n• Targeted to specific elements.\n• Example: element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, 'submit')))"
