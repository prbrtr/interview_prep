      "To set up a CI/CD pipeline for creating, cloning, and deleting Git repositories using GitHub Actions, follow these steps:",
      "1. **Create Two Git Repositories**:\n   - First, create two repositories on GitHub. Assume they are named `repo1` and `repo2`.",
      "2. **Set Up GitHub Actions**:\n   - GitHub Actions automates tasks within GitHub. Create a workflow file in your repository to handle cloning and deleting repositories.",
      "3. **Define Workflow**:\n   - Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your main repository, and within it, create a file named `ci-cd-pipeline.yml`. Here’s a sample GitHub Actions workflow:",
      "   ```yaml\n   name: CI/CD Pipeline for Git Repos\n   on: [push]\n   jobs:\n     clone-and-delete:\n       runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n       steps:\n         - name: Checkout code\n           uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n         - name: Set up Git\n           run: |\n             git config --global user.name 'GitHub Actions'\n             git config --global user.email 'actions@github.com'\n\n         - name: Clone repo1\n           run: |\n             git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo1.git\n             cd repo1\n             echo \"Repo1 cloned successfully!\"\n             cd ..\n\n         - name: Clone repo2\n           run: |\n             git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo2.git\n             cd repo2\n             echo \"Repo2 cloned successfully!\"\n             cd ..\n\n         - name: Delete repo1\n           run: |\n             rm -rf repo1\n             echo \"Repo1 deleted successfully!\"\n\n         - name: Delete repo2\n           run: |\n             rm -rf repo2\n             echo \"Repo2 deleted successfully!\"\n   ```",
      "4. **Explanation**:\n   - **Trigger**: The workflow runs on every push to the repository.\n   - **Jobs and Steps**:\n     - **Checkout code**: Checks out the code from your GitHub repository where this workflow file is stored.\n     - **Set up Git**: Configures Git user settings.\n     - **Clone repo1**: Clones the first repository and prints a success message.\n     - **Clone repo2**: Clones the second repository and prints a success message.\n     - **Delete repo1**: Deletes the first repository from the local workspace.\n     - **Delete repo2**: Deletes the second repository from the local workspace.",
      "5. **Running the Workflow**:\n   - **Commit the Workflow File**: Push the `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml` file to your main repository.\n   - **Monitor the Pipeline**: Navigate to the 'Actions' tab of your GitHub repository to see the workflow running.\n   - **Verify**: After the workflow runs, check that both repositories were cloned and then deleted as expected.",
      "6. **Notes**:\n   - Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username or organization name.\n   - Ensure the repositories are public or you’ve set up appropriate authentication if they are private.\n   - Adjust the workflow based on your actual requirements or environment."
