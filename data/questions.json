            "Shallow Copy:\nA shallow copy creates a new object but does not create copies of nested objects.\nInstead, it references the original nested objects.\n",
            "Modifying the nested objects in the shallow copy will affect the original object\nbecause they both reference the same nested objects.\n",
            "Deep Copy:\nA deep copy creates a new object and recursively creates copies of all objects found within the original object,\nresulting in a completely independent object.\n",
            "Modifying the nested objects in the deep copy will not affect the original object,\nas they are completely separate.\n"
