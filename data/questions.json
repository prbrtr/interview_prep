Characteristics: Shares the same inode number as the original file. Changes to the file are reflected in all hard links. The file is only deleted when all hard links are removed. Cannot span different filesystems or be created for directories (except by root in some cases). Example: # Create a file echo \"Hello World\" > original.txt # Create a hard link ln original.txt hardlink.txt # Both files are identical cat original.txt    # Outputs: Hello World cat hardlink.txt    # Outputs: Hello World Soft Link (Symbolic Link) Definition: A soft link (or symbolic link) is a special file that contains a reference to another file or directory in the form of a path. Characteristics: Has a different inode number and stores the path to the target file. Becomes a broken link if the original file is moved or deleted. Can span different filesystems and link to directories. Example: # Create a file echo \"Hello World\" > original.txt # Create a soft link ln -s original.txt softlink.txt # The soft link points to the original file cat softlink.txt    # Outputs: Hello World"

            "To run a command on Server 1 from Server 2 using SSH, use the following command: ssh user@server1 \"your-command-here\" # Example: Check disk usage on Server 1 ssh user@server1 \"df -h\" Explanation: user is the username on Server 1. server1 is the hostname or IP address of Server 1. \"your-command-here\" is the command you want to execute on Server 1. Optional for Automation: Set up SSH key-based authentication to avoid entering a password each time: 1. Generate SSH Key Pair on Server 2: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 2. Copy the Public Key to Server 1: ssh-copy-id user@server1 3. Run Commands Without Password: ssh user@server1 \"your-command-here\""
